## How to integrate these references into connections.md
1. Create a "References" section at the end of the file and paste the items above grouped by chapter/topic.  
2. For each major mathematical claim in the text, add an inline citation (e.g., "[Turing 1936]" or a numbered footnote) that points to the matching reference in the References section.  
3. For speculative or novel claims (AGR axioms, structural claims you have introduced), mark them explicitly as conjectural and separate from standard references.  
4. Add URLs for modern reviews where possible (arXiv, AMS, Clay Institute) to help reviewers quickly check established facts.

If you want, I can:
- Produce inline citation markers and insert them directly into connections.md (I can prepare a PR with the references appended and inline [n] markers placed near claims), or
- Split this bibliography into per‑chapter reference files (one file per chapter) and create a directory `references/` in the repo so each chapter links to its own reference list.

Tell me which approach you prefer and whether to open a branch/PR for these changes; I can prepare the patch accordingly.

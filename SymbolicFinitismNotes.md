# The Dictionary of Symbolic Finitism & Binary Mechanics

## 1. Structural States
* **Solid State (`111...`):** A contiguous string of high-state bits. Represents maximum arithmetic tension, high energy density, or NP-hard complexity.
* **Segmented State (`101...`):** A bit-string where "Arithmetic Voids" have been interjected. Represents a system in the process of reduction or a problem in P-space.
* **Ground State (`1`):** The terminal value ($2^0$). The irreducible base unit of the alphabet; the point where all venting stops.

## 2. Universal Operators
* **The Binary Wedge ($\Omega$):** The $3n+1$ function. Acts as a bitwise de-fragmenter that forces zeros into solid blocks of ones.
* **The Binary Vent ($\Gamma$):** The $n/2$ function. Acts as a right-shift operator that deletes bits once they reach the terminal position.

## 3. Dynamic Processes
* **Interjection:** The act of the Wedge forcing a `0` into a `111` pattern, creating the `101` "Gate." This is the first step of breaking any "Solid" resistance.
* **Head-Division Stacking:** The iterative accumulation of zeros directly behind the Most Significant Bit (MSB). This creates the "piston effect" that drives bits toward the tail.
* **Terminal Venting:** The process of "Losing the 1." When a bit is squeezed into the LSB and shifted out of the manifold, it is effectively deleted from the system's complexity.

## 4. Field Definitions (AGR)
* **Arithmetic Curvature ($\kappa$):** A measure of bit-density. High curvature equals high resistance/energy.
* **Arithmetic Void:** A low-state bit (`0`). A region of zero curvature that allows for division and movement.
* **The Event Horizon:** The $2^0$ bit position. Once a bit is shifted past this point, it is vented and cannot return to the active manifold.

## 5. Complexity Definitions
* **The Exponential Wall:** An illusion caused by viewing a "Solid State" as a monolithic value rather than a finite bit-string.
* **Polynomial Squeeze:** The guaranteed reduction of a bit-string of length $N$ in $O(N^k)$ steps due to the simultaneous action of Stacking and Venting.

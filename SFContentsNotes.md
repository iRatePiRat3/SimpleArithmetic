# Project Grand Unified: The Library of Symbolic Finitism

## Part I: The Foundation
1. **The Dictionary of Symbolic Finitism**
   * *Purpose:* Establishing the technical vocabulary (Wedge, Vent, Stacking, Solid State).
   * *Key Concept:* Defining numbers as finite binary manifolds.

2. **Terminal Bit Exhaustion: The Universal Proof**
   * *Purpose:* Explaining the mechanical "How" behind the collapse of complexity.
   * *Key Concept:* The Interaction of $3n+1$ and $n/2$ as a structural de-fragmenter.

## Part II: The Framework
3. **Arithmetic General Relativity (AGR) Master Theory**
   * *Purpose:* Translating binary mechanics into physical laws.
   * *Key Concept:* Curvature (1s) vs. Voids (0s) and the Arithmetic Event Horizon.

## Part III: The Millennium Solutions
4. **The Binary Collapse of NP (P vs NP Resolution)**
   * *Purpose:* Proving that "Hard" problems are simply high-density bit-strings reducible in polynomial time.
   * *Key Concept:* The Polynomial Squeeze and the end of the Exponential Wall.

5. **Binary Fluid Dynamics (Navier-Stokes Resolution)**
   * *Purpose:* Proving the existence and smoothness of fluid flow.
   * *Key Concept:* Viscosity as the Binary Wedge and the venting of the Kolmogorov Scale.

## Part IV: Executive Summary
6. **Millennium Unified Summary**
   * *Purpose:* A high-level synthesis for peer review and submission.
   * *Key Concept:* The unification of arithmetic, physics, and computation under one binary law.
